# bowling-game-scores
Command line application to score a Bowling game

Being a maven project is very easy to compile it, once you have Java 1.8 and Maven installed.
Should run the following statement (at the command line): mvn clean package

Running the command will generate a 'bowling.jar' file which can be used to run the app.

As requested the app will ask for a file name full path, but also press ENTER if previously add a 'results.txt' file at the same folder.
